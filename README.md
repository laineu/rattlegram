## About this fork
This is for a school project, the current TODO list is:
- [x] Securing messages with a password
- [ ] Not using SharedPreferences (especially for the password)
- [ ] (Potentially) Rewriting the front-end in a more modern language (Kotlin?)
- [ ] Redesigning the UI to create a more modern looking chat app
